    aboutme: "Washington, DC based artist and rising star Marshall Stukes’s core identity has been closely tied to the exposure and exploration of music. His lifelong, multi-genre musical journey began as a child with his parents exposing him to rap and hip-hop, R&B, and jazz; while self exploration as a teenager led to his love for rock and metal. Now his excursion has landed him in the world of techno and electronic music. Although he has loved music his whole life, Marshall started dabbling in music production after his best friend showed him FL Studio, a day which Marshall admits changed his life. After creating for over a decade, Marshall finally found his calling in producing techno, and has expanded his career as a resident DJ for two of DC’s prime techno all-nighters BLACK TECHNO MATTERS and Undertone. Whether it’s hard hitting 155bpm, or chill 130bpm, Marshall, who DJ’s and produces as STUKES, plays music that is true to who he is, past and present."
